I wanna share with you an interesting discovery on self-accelerating particles.

As we learn from our daily life, if something wants to accelerate, there has to be a force acting on it. For example, if there is no gravity, we no longer have the story of an apple falling on Sir Isaac Newton's head.

But physicists predicted early this year that some fundamental particles such as electrons can speed up without anything pushing on them. This amazing discovery is based on quantum mechanics, laws of nature that works on very small scales. Using the theory as a tool, physicists are able to engineer quantum mechanical structures of electrons so that they kind of "split" into two parts. The major part accelerates forward, and the rest part goes backward to compensate for it. It is a bit like a balloon ejecting air backwards to push itself along its way. So although self-accelerating electron sounds crazy, it still obeys physical laws, most importantly, conservation of momentum. The observed effect is exactly the same as an electron accelerating by electric force, or an apple accelerating by gravity, although no such external force ever exists.

This research is for the moment purely theoretical, it will be really exciting if people find these self-accelerating particles in a lab. Experimentalists can do lots of interesting things with these particles, for example, accelerating them to near the speed of light and exploring relativistic effects like time dilation, length contraction and twin paradox. It will be much easier and cheaper than working on a huge particle accelerator to produce these effects.

I am very excited about this. And I hope experimental results will come out soon.
