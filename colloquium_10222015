Does an isolated quantum system relax?

One dimensional systems

Bose gas in elongated trap
Uniform density, fluctuating phase
Longitudinal phase fluctuations are key

Lieb-Liniger model: exactly solvable

Luttinger-liquid
Excitations are phonons
Linear dispersion

Sine-Gordon
Long-lived excitations

Atom chip

Interference of phase
create a copy by splitting / create two independent samples
quantum connected / classically separated
narrow dist of phase / random phase

Repeat measurement many times and plot as circular stats
Full distribution function of phase & contrast

Independently created 1d condensates
Aver = 0, Var > 0

Split n1,phi1 and n2,phi2
sym combination and antisym combination
sym is thermally populated
antisym is populated by quantum fluctuations

Thermal equibrium
equal populations sym and antisym

Mean squared contrast initial rapid decay

Short length scale: phase diffusion regime
Long length scale: contrast decay regime

Generalized Gibbs ensemble
a Lagrange multiplier for every mode

Correlations outside the light cone imprinted by the quench
8 mode model describes the relaxed state

Relaxation in quantum systems does not procees through a simple path: prethermalization

Relaxed state emerges locally and spreads thruout the system in a light cone

Prethermalized state is associated with a Generalized Gibbs Ensemble
