Physics and Cosmology with the CMB
John Carlstrom
U Chicago

Inflation
Universe expands by >=e^60

Physics at recombination
universe cools enough to form neutral H

Reionization "Cosmic Dawn"

Structure Formation

Cosmic Acceleration

struc. form. thru lensing of CMB

1965 Discovery of CMB
CMB Anisotropy 1/10^5

South Pole Telescope SPT

Bolometer array
SiN subtrate with gold absorber

Inflation checks
geometrical flat universe
superhorizon features
acoustic peaks/adiabatic fluctuations
Gaussian fluctuations
departure from scale invariance
inflationary gravatitional waves

The energy density of the universe
Today: 4.6% atoms 23% DM 72% DE
13.7 billion y ago 10% neutrino 15% photons 12% atoms 62 % DE

Damping scale (Silk damping)

Large-scale structure lenses the CMB

Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect

~1% of CMB photons traversing a massive galaxy cluster scatter

CMB-S4
polarization sensitivity of ~1uK-arcm over >=70% of the sky
